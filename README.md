# Double Fed Induction Generator & Battery Energy Storage System Simulink Model

With the significant increase in the insertion of wind turbines in the electrical system, 
the overall inertia of the system is reduced resulting in a loss of its ability to support frequency. 
This is because it is common to use variable speed wind turbines, based on the Double Fed Induction 
Generator (DFIG), which are coupled to the power grid through electronic converters, which do not have 
the same characteristics as synchronous generators. Thus, this repository proposes the use of the 
DFIG-associated Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to support the primary frequency. A control 
strategy was developed, and important factors such as charging and discharging current limitations 
and operation within battery limits were considered.
